# PoC

Files of our Proof of Concept (in the course Embedded Systems of our 4th year of engeenering school in ESILV) system called PocPocPoc. 

To put into context, we research and develop with our Pi² project, a system with the architecture firm MISSIM, a new concept for low-cost, energy-intensive building renovations from the outside with a scalable, green wall. It could be added on different kinds of buildings such as hotels, offices, houses and so on. When the subject of watering our green walls comes, we thought that the rain and a simple sprinkler will be enough. However, it was not really in adequation with our energetic transition major and way of thinking : we did not want a system that waste water, a precious asset. It makes sense for our team to develop a smart and connected watering system for green walls for our Pi² project (green walls) since our mission is similar and is easily suitable.  
We consider it as a satisfying task because this allows us to see beyond the school aspect working in collaboration with this visionary company.

Enjoy !
